The following files and features related to digital gold should be deleted from the project:

- sanity/schemaTypes/digitalGoldProductType.ts
- sanity/schemaTypes/digitalGoldOrderType.ts
- components/gold/GoldProductsClient.tsx
- components/gold/GoldProductsWithCartProvider.tsx
- update-digital-gold-products.js
- All digital gold-related pages in app/gold and app/gold/orders

Also remove their imports and references from:
- sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts
- Any other files referencing digital gold product/order types or components

This will fully remove the digital gold feature from the codebase.
